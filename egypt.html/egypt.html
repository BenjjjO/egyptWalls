                Hieroglyphs consist of three kinds of glyphs: phonetic glyphs,
                including single-consonant characters that function like an
                alphabet; logographs, representing morphemes; and
                determinatives, which narrow down the meaning of logographic or

                The gods were generally said to be immanent in these
                phenomenaâ€”to be present within nature.[36] The types of
                phenomena they represented include physical places and objects
                as well as abstract concepts and forces.[37] The god Shu was the
                deification of all the world's air; the goddess Meretseger
                oversaw a limited region of the earth, the Theban Necropolis;
                and the god Sia personified the abstract notion of
                perception.[38] Major gods were often involved in several types
                of phenomena. For instance, Khnum was the god of Elephantine
                Island in the midst of the Nile, the river that was essential to
                Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual
                Nile flood that fertilized the country's farmland. Perhaps as an
                outgrowth of this life-giving function, he was said to create
                all living things, fashioning their bodies on a potter's
                wheel.[39] Gods could share the same role in nature; Ra, Atum,
                Khepri, Horus, and other deities acted as sun gods.[40] Despite
                their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in
                common: maintaining maat, the universal order that was a central
                principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a
                goddess.[41] Yet some deities represented disruption to maat.
                Most prominently, Apep was the force of chaos, constantly
                threatening to annihilate the order of the universe, and Set was
                an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight
                disorder and foment it.

                sacred powers and position to the new pharaoh, his son. The
                pharaoh's divine status was portrayed in allegorical terms:
                his uraeus (the snake on his crown) spat flames at his
                enemies; he was able to trample thousands of the enemy on the
                battlefield; and he was all-powerful, knowing everything and
                controlling nature and fertility.

                Sekhmet is the daughter of the sun god, Ra, and is among the
                more important of the goddesses in the Egyptian Pantheon.
                Sekhmet acted as the vengeful manifestation of Ra's power, the
                Eye of Ra. Sekhmet is said to breathe fire, and the hot winds
                of the desert were likened to her breath. She is also believed
                to cause plagues (which were described as being her servants
                or messengers) although she is also called upon to ward off
                disease and heal the sick.
